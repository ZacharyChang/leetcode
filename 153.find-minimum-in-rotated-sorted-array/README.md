# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
-----
## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
Find the minimum element.
You may assume ```no duplicate exists``` in the array.

## Example
### Example 1
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1

### Example 2
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
