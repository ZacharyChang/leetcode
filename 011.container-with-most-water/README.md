# Container With Most Water
-----
## Description

Given n `non-negative integers` a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

![](../images/011_example.jpg)
The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

## Note
* You may not slant the container and `n is at least 2`.
