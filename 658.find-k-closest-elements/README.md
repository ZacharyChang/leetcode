# Find K Closest Elements
-----
## Description
Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the ```smaller elements``` are always preferred.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

## Note
1. The value k is positive and will always be ```smaller than the length``` of the sorted array.
2. Length of the given array is positive and will ```not exceed 104```
3. Absolute value of elements in the array and x will ```not exceed 104```
