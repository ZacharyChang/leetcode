## Description
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is ```case sensitive```, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

## Example

7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```
