# Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
-----
## Description
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ```ascending order```, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## Note
* Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are ```not zero-based```.
* You may assume that each input would have ```exactly one solution``` and you may ```not use the same element twice```.
