# Intersection of Two Arrays II
-----
## Description
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their ```intersection```.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
```

## Note
* Each element in the result should appear as many times as ```it shows in both arrays```.
* The result can be ```in any order```.

## Follow up
* What if the given array is ```already sorted```? How would you optimize your algorithm?
* What if ```nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size```? Which algorithm is better?
* What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and ```the memory is limited``` such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
