# Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
-----
## Description
Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is ```incrementing a selected element by 1``` or ```decrementing a selected element by 1```.

You may assume the array's length is at most ```10,000```.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
```
