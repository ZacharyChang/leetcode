# Maximum Subarray
-----
## Description
Given an integer array nums, find the ```contiguous``` subarray (containing ```at least one number```) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## Example
Input: ```[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]```,
Output: ```6```
Explanation: ```[4,-1,2,1]``` has the largest ```sum = 6```.

## Follow up
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the ```divide and conquer``` approach, which is more subtle.
