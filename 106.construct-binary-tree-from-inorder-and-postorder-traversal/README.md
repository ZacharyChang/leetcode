# Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal
-----
## Description
Given ```inorder``` and ```postorder``` traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

## Example
### Example 1
```
For example, given

inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Return the following binary tree:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

## Note
You may assume that ```duplicates do not exist``` in the tree.
