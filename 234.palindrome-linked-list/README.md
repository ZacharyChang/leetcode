# Palindrome Linked List
-----
## Description
Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input: 1->2
Output: false
```

### Example 2
```
Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true
```

## Follow up
Could you do it in ```O(n) time``` and ```O(1) space```?

## Notes
* You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
* You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
