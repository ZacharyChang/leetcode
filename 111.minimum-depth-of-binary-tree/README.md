# Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
-----
## Description
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the ```shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node```.

## Note
A leaf is a node with ```no children```.

### Example
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its minimum depth = 2.
```
