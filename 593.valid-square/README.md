# Valid Square
-----
## Description
Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four points could ```construct a square```.

The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two integers.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: True
```

## Note
1. All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
2. A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
3. Input points have ```no order```.
