# Median of Two Sorted Arrays
-----
## Description
There are two `sorted arrays` nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the `median` of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

## Example
### Example 1
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

### Example 2
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
