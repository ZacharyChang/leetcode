# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
-----
## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ```ascending order``` is ```rotated at some pivot unknown``` to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the ```minimum element```.

The array may ```contain duplicates```.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2
```
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
