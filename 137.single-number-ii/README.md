# Single Number II
-----
## Description
Given a `non-empty` array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

## Example
### Example 1
```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2
```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

## Note
Your algorithm should have a `linear runtime complexity`. Could you implement it `without using extra memory`?
